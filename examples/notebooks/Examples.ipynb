    "February’s four session meetup series we’ll be working with long term hydrophone recordings from University of Hawaii's Aloha Cabled Observatory (ACO - http://aco-ssds.soest.hawaii.edu), located at a depth of 4728m off Oahu (N22◦45.110' W158◦00'). The recordings span a year and contain many acoustic events: wave movements, the sound of rain, ship noise, possible bomb noises, geologic activity and whale calls and songs. There is a wide range of project topics to explore: identifying and counting acoustic events such as whale calls, measuring daily or seasonal noise trends, measuring wave hydrodynamics, etc. Note: be sure to bring a good headset – there are some interesting sounds in the recordings!\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone from beginners to experts are welcome. As always, our three objectives are: 1. Provide skill-level-appropriate challenges to all participants. 2. Participants collaborate with and learn from one another. 3. Those who attend all four Sundays finish a project they can add to their github/resume/portfolio. Bring your favorite data analysis software! We're language-agnostic. If you don't already have a favorite analysis tool, here are a few suggestions: http://goo.gl/W8Q6cV"
